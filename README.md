# ActiveCollab Probe

Use ``probe.php`` script to check if your system can run [ActiveCollab](https://www.activecollab.com/index.html) or not.

Supported versions:

* ActiveCollab 7.3 and newer

Detailed documentation on system's requirements is available [here](https://activecollab.com/help/books/self-hosted-activecollab/requirements).

## Instructions

1. Download latest ``probe.php`` from GitHub, 
1. Open ``probe.php`` using your favorite text editor and set database connection parameters. ``DB_HOST`` is your MySQL hostname, ``DB_USER`` is MySQL account that you will be used to connect to the server, ``DB_PASS`` is account password, and ``DB_NAME`` is the name of database that you plan to use, 
1. Upload it to the server where you plan to host ActiveCollab, 
1. Visit ``probe.php`` using your browser. Script will run the test and show you the results.

Each test can have one of the three outputs:

1. **OK** (ðŸŸ¢ green) - requirement is met.
1. **Warning** (ðŸŸ  orange) - test did not pass, but ActiveCollab does not require that environment option to run. Warnings are usually thrown in case of missing extensions that are optional, but good to have, or in cases of early warning about deprecated functionality.
1. **Error** (ðŸ”´ red) - requirement is not met and you will not be able to run ActiveCollab until you reconfigure your environment to support it. Errors are throw in case of missing extensions, or environment settings that will break ActiveCollab (like some unsupported opcode cache extensions).

That's it!

## Remove when Done

When you are done, don't forget to remove the script from your server. This is a debugging type of software, that may show too much info about your platform to someone who should not be able to access that data. Because of that, it's highly recommended that you remove it from production server as soon as you complete a task at hand (installing or troubleshooting ActiveCollab).
